            Dear Pastor, I am a 33-year-old man. I was living with a woman for
            three years. I broke up with her because she was two-timing me.
            Whenever I went to work, she allowed men to come to the house.
            Neighbours told me about it and one of the neighbours used to go to
            the house to see her and he told people that I was such a fool. She
            quit her job and was home for a year. She and I had a big fight
            because I came home and I knew that she had just had sex.

            Dear Pastor, I have been in a relationship since November 2020. At
            the time when we met, my partner told me that he had two daughters.
            Last September, he told me that there is a possibility that he may
            have a son, as he was playing around with a woman who lived with her
            partner and she got pregnant. So, there is a possibility that the
            son she has may be his. Around February of this year, he told me
            that a friend of his told him that the child is his.

          <p>
            Dear Pastor, I have been married for 13 years and I love my husband.
            We live happily. He said I was a good wife to him. He didn't want me
            to go out to work, but I did my little buying and selling right at
            our gate. I didn't have to depend on him for anything. I sold
            everything. Farmers used to come by with goods and I used to buy
            from them and sell back to the people in the area. Even taxi men
            would stop and buy drinks from me. I also had a patty warmer which I
            kept on my verandah, and I sold patties to everybody.
